Homework 2
OCNG 689

All of the functions required for the homework are written in
the script HW2_mod.py.  There is an idividual run script for 
each problem where q1 means question 1, q2 means question 2, etc.
All of the problems which require plotting, the plot is saved instead
of being displayed.
